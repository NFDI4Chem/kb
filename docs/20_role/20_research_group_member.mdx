This article applies to research group members (PhD students, Postdocs and other scientists), who are generating scientific data.

## Motivation

As a research group member, you are the one who is doing actual research. That means that you are generating lots of data while working practically or theoretically, e.g., analytical data or reaction protocols. All these data are accompanied by [metadata](/docs/topics/metadata). As a scientist, you are responsible for the [documentation](/docs/data/data_documentation) of this data in order to ensure that the data can be archived in a [FAIR](/docs/topics/fair) (**F**indable, **A**ccessible, **I**nteroperable, **R**e-usable) way. Many funding institutions encourage or even enforce the publication of FAIR data. Therefore, your [supervisor](/docs/role/research_group_leader) should provide you with information on how to handle your data or even [data management plans](/docs/data/dmp) for good [data organisation](/docs/data/data_organisation) practices.

## Data handling

In the last years, many new digital tools have been developed to support the researchers in their RDM needs. In short, the technical possibilities are explained below. For more details, please refer to the related chapters. If you want to learn more about domain-specific data production methods, have a look at the [domain-specific profiles](/docs/domains/guide).

The most efficient way to handle your research data and corresponding [metadata](/docs/topics/metadata) properly starts already with planning of the experiment according to the [data life cycle](/docs/topics/data_life_cycle) (figure below). To have all data directly available digitally, the use of [electronic lab notebooks (ELNs)](/docs/topics/eln) is strongly recommended. ELNs can support you in your daily work, such as the planning of the experiment or data processing and analysis. For example, after peak assignment in the obtained spectroscopic data – which can all be performed in one digital environment – peak lists can automatically be generated by the ELN for theses or publications. Furthermore, ELNs are very powerful for preparing your data for [data publication](/docs/data/data_publication) in suitable [repositories](/docs/topics/repositories) and for [data storage and archiving](/docs/data/data_storage). Thus, you are facilitating the future research in your working group by assembling an internal database in an invaluable way. In addition to the group you are working in, publishing [well-organised](/docs/data/data_organisation) and [documented](/docs/data/data_documentation) research data can help other researchers significantly in terms of searching and re-using your data. [Best practice examples](/docs/topics/best_practice) can guide you to better understand how efficient data handling works.

## Recommendations – how to start

The use of an ELN for data handling has clear advantages (see above). Generally, selecting an [ELN](/docs/topics/eln) and a [repository](/docs/topics/repositories) for data deposition depends on the [chemical sub-domain](/docs/domains/guide). Since 60 % of the chemists work synthetically, we recommend the electronic lab notebook [Chemotion ELN](https://www.chemotion.net/chemotionsaurus/) in combination with the repository [Chemotion-Repository](https://www.chemotion-repository.net/welcome). Therefore, some advantages of using Chemotion as a whole are listed here:
-	[Data life cycle](/docs/topics/data_life_cycle) fully covered – from experiment planning to publication.
-	Drawing of chemical structures – automatic calculation of quantities and yields.
-	Many spectra can be directly analysed in the environment of Chemotion using ChemSpectra.
-	Experimental information for the experimental part of theses or publications can be generated and exported by the software – no manual peak listing needed.
-	A plausibility check is available for NMR spectra.
-	Integration of SciFinder search.
-	Building up an internal database – advancing collaboration and data exchange in the group.
-	Seamless export from ELN to repository as FAIR deposit of the data with a [persistent identifier (DOI)](/docs/topics/pid) for each molecule.
-	User management – access rights, sharing and syncing.
-	Academic version for free.
-	When running your own Chemotion instance, you keep control over your data.

For more information on Chemotion, the [Chemotion introductory video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZHaP6DW-Dw) (in German) provides a good overview of Chemotion as a tool in research data management. No matter if you are working with Chemotion, another [ELN](/docs/topics/eln) or a traditional handwritten notebook, the data need to be stored in a repository according to the [FAIR principles](/docs/topics/fair). If you are not using the Chemotion ELN, you can still deposit your data in the Chemotion-Repository. In addition, a plethora of [repositories](/docs/topics/repositories) exists in chemistry, some of them are sub-domain specific, such as [MassBank](https://massbank.eu/MassBank/) for mass spectrometry data.
