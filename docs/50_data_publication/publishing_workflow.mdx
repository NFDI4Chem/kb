# A Simple Guide to Publishing Your Research Data

As a researcher in chemistry, sharing your data is crucial for advancing science and ensuring your work is accessible to others. This guide will walk you through the essential steps and considerations for publishing your research data effectively.

## 1. Identify Yourself and Your Institution

Before you publish, make sure to provide your [**ORCID iD**](https://info.orcid.org/researchers/)—a unique identifier that helps distinguish you from other researchers. Similarly to article submission systems, most research data repository provide fields for this information. To get your identifier, simply register yourself through [ORCID's registration site](https://orcid.org/register).

Additionally, use the [**ROR identifier** (Research Organization Registry)](https://ror.org/about/) to clearly identify your institution. Many research data repositories already provide search functionality to autofill this information. Otherwise, find your instition's identifier at [ror.org](https://ror.org/).

These identifiers help improve the visibility of your work.

## 2. Use Persistent Identifiers (PIDs)

When you deposit your research data, it will be assigned a [**persistent identifier (PID)**](/pid), similarly to how your article is designed a DOI (Digital Object Identifier). Here’s how to use it:

- **For Your Own Datasets:** Include the PID in the data availability statement of your article, which informs readers where they can find your underlying data. Also, add this PID in the references section of your manuscript to cite it specifically.
  
- **For Others’ Datasets:** If you reuse datasets published by other researchers, include their PIDs in your references instead of just citing their articles. This not only gives proper credit but also helps others locate those datasets easily.

## 3. Link Your Datasets with Articles

To enhance discoverability, link your datasets directly to their corresponding articles:

- Add the article's DOI as a related identifier in the metadata of your dataset when submitting it to a repository.
  
- Use the relation type `IsSupplementTo` when linking datasets with articles, as recommended by Crossref and DataCite guidelines.

Many repository will guide you here, offering dropdown menus to select the appropriate relation and identifier type.

## 4. Utilize Collection DOIs

If you are working with multiple datasets relevant to one article, consider using a **Collection DOI** provided by repositories:

- Include this Collection DOI in the data availability statement of your manuscript so all related research objects are connected.
  
- For individual reactions or specific analytical data within those collections, cite them separately with their respective DOIs in both text and reference sections.

## 5. Ensure Findability and Interoperability

By following these steps—using ORCID iDs and ROR identifiers, employing PIDs correctly, linking datasets appropriately, and utilizing Collection DOIs—you significantly enhance the findability and interoperability of your research data. This means others can easily access and build upon your findings!
Absolutely! Here’s an additional section to include in the article about choosing a license for your research data:

## 6. Choose a License for Your Data

When publishing your research data, it's essential to choose an appropriate [license](/licences). A license outlines how others can use, share, and build upon your work. Here are some key points to consider when selecting a license:

### Why Licensing Matters

Licensing is crucial because it sets the rules for how others can interact with your data. A clear license helps prevent misuse and ensures that you receive proper credit for your contributions.

### Common Types of Licenses

1. **Creative Commons Licenses**: These licenses are widely used for sharing research data and come in various forms:
   - **CC BY**: Allows others to distribute, remix, adapt, and build upon your work, even commercially, as long as they credit you.
   - **CC BY-SA**: Similar to CC BY but requires new creations to carry the same license.
   - **CC BY-NC**: Allows others to use your work non-commercially while still requiring attribution.

2. **Open Data Commons Licenses**: Specifically designed for databases and datasets:
   - **ODC Public Domain Dedication (PDDL)**: Places the dataset in the public domain, allowing anyone to use it without restrictions.
   - **ODC Attribution License (ODC-By)**: Requires attribution but allows any type of use.

3. **Institutional or Publisher-Specific Licenses**: Some institutions or publishers may have their own licensing requirements or recommendations. Be sure to check these guidelines before deciding on a license.

### How to Choose a License

- **Consider Your Goals**: Think about how you want others to use your data. If you encourage widespread use and adaptation, opt for more permissive licenses like CC BY.
  
- **Understand Legal Implications**: Make sure you're comfortable with what rights you're granting by choosing a particular license.

- **Seek Guidance if Needed**: If you're unsure which license is best suited for your data, consult with colleagues or check resources from organizations specializing in open science. 

### Communicate Your License Clearly

Once you've chosen a license, make sure it's clearly stated alongside your dataset when submitting it to repositories. This transparency will help users understand their rights and responsibilities regarding your work.

## Conclusion

Publishing research data might seem daunting at first, but by following these straightforward guidelines tailored for chemists, you’ll contribute positively to scientific discourse while ensuring that others can benefit from and verify your work.
