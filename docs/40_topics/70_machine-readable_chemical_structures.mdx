## Introduction

Finding relevant articles based on IUPAC names or trivial names of molecules is a challenging task, while chemical identifiers allow for unambiguous identification of compounds. Redrawing of chemical structures is labour- and time intensive, while chemical table (CT) files can be used without any additional effort with any common structure drawing software. 

Having machine-readable chemical structures as **[CT files](/docs/topics/ct_files)** such as mol files, **[InChI](/docs/topics/inchi)** identifiers and **[SMILES](/docs/topics/smiles)** structure codes as part of a dataset associated with a research article will enhance its **[findability](/docs/topics/fair)** by making the article easily indexable and structure-searchable. This also improves **[interoperability](/docs/topics/fair)** and facilitates **[reuse](/docs/topics/fair)** of scientific work.

The following will provide a tutorial on how to increase the machine-readability of chemistry research articles by providing machine-readable chemical structures as data files. Moreover, recommendations to provide structure codes and identifiers in a machine-readable supplementary table within the associated dataset are given.

Please note that there are currently limitations with **[SMILES](docs/topics/smiles)** and **[InChI](docs/topics/inchi)** for inorganic and especially organometallic compounds. 

## Get mol files

All common structure drawing software save mol files. Copy the structure to a new document within your preferred structure drawing software. Then, choose File -> Save As -> choose MDL Molfile from the dropdown menu -> Save.

The name of the file might be chosen following your lab journal entry and also numbering of the structure in the article.

## SMILES, InChI and InChIKey and Supplemental Table

### ChemDoodle

To retrieve SMILES, InChI and InChIKey in ChemDoodle select a structure, then choose Edit -> Copy As -> Daylight SMILES or IUPAC InChI. 

<img align="center" src={useBaseUrl('/img/topics/Screenshots_ChemDoodle_SMILES_InChI_InChIKey.png')} alt="ChemDoodle_SMILES_InChI_InChIKey" />


(ChemDoodle v11.7.0, iChemLabs, LCC., Chesterfield, VA, United States, 2021.)

You may also select a structure, then choose Structure -> Generate Line Notation -> Daylight SMILES or IUPAC InChI.

Alternatively, SMILES, InChI and InChIKey can also be saved as text files by choosing File -> Save as -> choose Daylight SMILES or InChI from the dropdown menu -> Save.

Choosing “IUPAC InChI” will also provide the InChIKey if enabled under Preferences. To include InChIKey, choose Edit -> Preferences -> Files tab -> scroll down and tick Include InChI key. 

### ChemDraw Professional

To retrieve SMILES, InChI and InChIKey in ChemDraw Professional, select a structure, then choose Edit -> Copy As -> SMILES, InChI or InChIKey.

(ChemDraw Professional v20.1.0.11, PerkinElmer Informatics, Inc., Waltham, MA, United States, 2021.)

### ChemSketch

To retrieve SMILES, InChI and InChIKey in ACD/ChemSketch, select a structure, then choose Tools-> Generate -> SMILES Notation or InChI for Structure.

<img align="center" src={useBaseUrl('/img/topics/Screenshots_ChemSketch_SMILES_InChI_InChIKey.png')} alt="ChemDoodle_SMILES_InChI_InChIKey" />


(ACD/ChemSketch v2021.1.1, Advanced Chemistry Development, Inc., Toronto, ON, Canada, 2021.) 

Choosing InChI for Structure will also provide the InChIKey, if enabled under InChI Options. To include InChIKey, choose Tools -> Generate -> InChI Options and tick InChI Key. 

### MarvinSketch

To retrieve SMILES, InChI and InChIKey in MarvinSketch select a structure, then choose Edit -> Copy As. In a new windows choose Daylight SMILES, InChI/RInChI or InChIKey/RInChIKey.

<img align="center" src={useBaseUrl('/img/topics/Screenshots_MarvinSketch_SMILES_InChI_InChIKey.png')} alt="ChemDoodle_SMILES_InChI_InChIKey" />


(MarvinSketch v21.18, ChemAxon, Ltd., Budapest, Hungary, 2021.)

Alternatively, SMILES, InChI and InChIKey can also be saved as text files by choosing File -> Save as -> choose Daylight SMILES, InChI/RInChI or InChIKey/RInChIKey from the dropdown menu -> Save.

## Provide machine-readable data as supplementary table

While the data files can be directly added to the dataset, additional information to enhance machine-readability might be provided as a **[supplementary table](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13321-021-00520-4)**. This table should be also provided in a machine-readable text-based format such as a .csv file. 

It is recommended to add the following columns to this table:
- number of structure in the research article
- letter-code and number in your lab journal
- SMILES
- InChI and InChIKey

The letter-code and number in your lab journal should be included, as analytical data files in a dataset are frequently named following the lab journal entries.

Additionally, this table may also include further columns for:
- IUPAC name
- synonym, i.e. common and trivial names of a compound 
- PubChem_CIDs
- CAS_RN
- comment (if required)

Templates for this table are provide as [.ods](/doc/machine-readable_supplementary_table_template.ods), [.xlsx](/doc/machine-readable_supplementary_table_template.xlsx) and [.csv](/doc/machine-readable_supplementary_table_template.csv) files. These template files also take advantage of **[ontologies](/docs/topics/ontology)** to unambiguously identify terms for humans and machines. PubChem_CIDs as well as CAS_RN are easily retrieved in **[PubChem](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)** by searching via SMILES, InChI or InChIKey.

In an ideal world, this table including all the compiled information is provided by an **[ELN](/docs/topics/eln)**. Chemotion ELN generates **[SMILES](/docs/topics/smiles)**, **[InChI](/docs/topics/inchi)**, InChIKey as well as RInChI and RInChIKey for compounds and reactions.
